In additional to my work at Q2 Solutions I have also been working on side projects to keep my data science skills sharp by actively applying them to different data sets an scenarios.
This has also allowed me to learn new tools to add to my programming vocabulary to expande my knowlegde of bioinformatics, data sceince and statistics.
